<h2 color="white">Facts about Pluto</h2><ul class="white"><br><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto is named after the Greek god of the underworld.</strong><br /></p>
This is a later name for the more well known Hades and was proposed by Venetia Burney an eleven year old schoolgirl from Oxford, England.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.</strong><br /></p>
This is when the IAU formalised the definition of a planet as “A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.”</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930 by the Lowell Observatory.</strong><br /></p>
For the 76 years between Pluto being discovered and the time it was reclassified as a dwarf planet it completed under a third of its orbit around the Sun.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto has five known moons.</strong><br/></p>
The moons are Charon (discovered in 1978,), Hydra and Nix (both discovered in 2005), Kerberos originally P4 (discovered 2011) and Styx originally P5 (discovered 2012) official designations S/2011 (134340) 1 and  S/2012 (134340) 1.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto is the largest dwarf planet.</strong><br /></p>
At one point it was thought this could be Eris. Currently the most accurate measurements give Eris an average diameter of 2,326km with a margin of error of 12km, while Pluto&#8217;s diameter is 2,372km with a 2km margin of error.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto is one third water.</strong><br /> </p>
This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much water as in all the Earth&#8217;s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock. Pluto&#8217;s surface is covered with ices, and has several mountain ranges, light and dark regions, and a scattering of craters.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto is smaller than a number of moons.</strong><br /></p>
These are Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, Europa, Triton, and the Earth’s moon. Pluto has 66% of the diameter of the Earth&#8217;s moon and 18% of its mass. While it is now confirmed that Pluto is the largest dwarf planet for around 10 years it was thought that this was Eris.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto has a eccentric and inclined orbit.</strong><br /></p>
This takes it between 4.4 and 7.3 billion km from the Sun meaning Pluto is periodically closer to the Sun than Neptune.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft.</strong><br /></p>
The <em>New Horizons</em> spacecraft, which was launched in 2006, flew by Pluto on the 14th of July 2015 and took a series of images and other measurements. <em>New Horizons</em> is now on its way to the Kuiper Belt to explore even more distant objects.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto&#8217;s location was predicted by Percival Lowell in 1915.</strong><br /></p>
The prediction came from deviations he initially observed in 1905 in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.</li><br>
<li><p class="bold"><strong>Pluto sometimes has an atmosphere.</strong><br /></p>
When Pluto elliptical orbit takes it closer to the Sun, its surface ice thaws and forms a thin atmosphere primarily of nitrogen which slowly escapes the planet. It also has a methane haze that overs about 161 kilometres above the surface. The methane is dissociated by sunlight into hydrocarbons that fall to the surface and coat the ice with a dark covering. When Pluto travels away from the Sun the atmosphere then freezes back to its solid state.</li><br>
